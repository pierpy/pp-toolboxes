% GENERATEDATA Generates 2D data for clustering; data is created along 
%              straight lines, which can be more or less parallel depending
%              on slopeStd argument.

%
% Inputs:
%        slope - Base direction of the lines on which clusters are based.
%     slopeStd - Standard deviation of the slope; used to obtain a random
%                slope variation from the normal distribution, which is
%                added to the base slope in order to obtain the final slope
%                of each cluster.
%    numClusts - Number of clusters (and therefore of lines) to generate.
% xClustAvgSep - Average separation of line centers along the X axis.
% yClustAvgSep - Average separation of line centers along the Y axis.
%    lengthAvg - The base length of lines on which clusters are based.
%    lengthStd - Standard deviation of line length; used to obtain a random
%                length variation from the normal distribution, which is
%                added to the base length in order to obtain the final
%                length of each line.
%   lateralStd - "Cluster fatness", i.e., the standard deviation of the 
%                distance from each point to the respective line, in both x 
%                and y directions; this distance is obtained from the 
%                normal distribution.
%  totalPoints - Total points in generated data (will be 
%                randomly divided among clusters).
%
% Outputs:
%         data - Matrix (totalPoints x 2) with the generated data
%  clustPoints - Vector (numClusts x 1) containing number of points in each 
%                cluster
%          idx - Vector (totalPoints x 1) containing the cluster indices of 
%                each point
%      centers - Matrix (numClusts x 2) containing centers from where
%                clusters were generated
%       slopes - Vector (numClusts x 1) containing the effective slopes 
%                used to generate clusters
%      lengths - Vector (numClusts x 1) containing the effective lengths 
%                used to generate clusters

% Usage example:
%
%   [data cp idx] = GENERATEDATA(1, 0.5, 5, 15, 15, 5, 1, 2, 200);
%
% This creates 5 clusters with a total of 200 points, with a base slope 
% of 1 (std=0.5), separated in average by 15 units in both x and y 
% directions, with average length of 5 units (std=1) and a "fatness" or
% spread of 2 units.
%
% To take a quick look at the clusters just do:
%
%   scatter(data(:,1), data(:,2), 8, idx);

% Initialize idx (vector containing the cluster indices of each point)

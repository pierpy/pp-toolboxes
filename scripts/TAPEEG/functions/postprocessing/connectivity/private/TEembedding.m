function pointset = TEembedding(ts_1,ts_2,dim,tau,u,extracond)

% TEEMBEDDING: This function embeds the provided data and returns the
% the embedded pointsets. The output is intendet for later use in GPU 
% TE-calculation.
%
%
% * REFERENCE INFORMATION
%     - The concept of TE appears in Schreiber's article,
%       "Measuring Information Transfer", Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 461 - 464
%       (2000).
%     - For the estimation of probability densities needed for the TE
%       computation, the function implements the Kraskov-Stoegbauer-
%       Grassberger estimator described in Kraskov et al. "Estimating
%       mutual information", Phys. Rev. E 69 (6) 066138, (2004).
%
%
% * INPUT PARAMETERS
%
%  ts_1 = source time series
%  ts_2 = target time series (should be of equal length as ts_1)
%  dim  = embedding dimension
%  tau  = embedding delay in number of sampled points AND points 
%         ahead for the advance vector in number of sampled points 
%  u    = points ahead for the advance vector in number of sampled
%         points (from ts_1 to ts_2 prediction point only)
%
%  extracond = perform conditioning in te tansfer entropy formula on
%                  additional variables. Values:
%                     'Faes_Method' - include the future sample of the 
%                     source at the prediction time into the state vector
%                     of the past of of the target to condition on it.
%                     In principle, this removes any volume conduction effect.
%                     (Faes L. et al, Phys Rev E, 2011)
%                     'Battaglia_Method' - NOT implemented yet. This
%                     methods conditions on the "mean activity" of the
%                     system, i.e. a global system state.This will be done
%                     by creating a channel carrying that signal which will
%                     then be used as an addional entry for the past state
%                     of the source

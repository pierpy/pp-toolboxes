changes from 2.4 are methods to extract data directly from xml structure :

as usual :

1. read an xml file and store it into z :
z = xmltools('filename.xml'); 

2. write z into the file :
xmltools(z,'filename.xml'); 

3. returns only subset of z child which name is tag-name :
xmltools(z,'get','tag-name'); 

and now:

4. returns only subset of z child which attrib is attrib-name :
xmltools(z,'get-attrib', 'attrib-name')

5. returns only attribs/value or children of subset of z child which name is tag-name :
xmltools(z,'get','tag-name', 'attribs'|'value'|'child');

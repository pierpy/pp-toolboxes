This scripts allow to generate simulated EEG signal composed of superposition
of phasic peak and noise. The signal is generated in a format of EEGLAB -
a popular tool for analysis of EEG data.

EEGLAB can be downloaded from

A brief tutorial on generating artificial data using these functions can be found at:

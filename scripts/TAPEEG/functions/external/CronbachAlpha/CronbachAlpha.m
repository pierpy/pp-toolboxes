% Description:	calculate Cronbach's alpha for a set of psychometric measurements
% 
% Syntax:	[as,au] = CronbachAlpha(x)
% 
% In:
% 	x	- an nRep x nItem array of ratings, so that each row is the set of
%		  obvservations from one repetition and each column is the set of all
%		  observations for a given item
% 
% Out:
% 	as	- the standardized Cronbach's alpha
%	au	- the unstandardized Cronbach's alpha

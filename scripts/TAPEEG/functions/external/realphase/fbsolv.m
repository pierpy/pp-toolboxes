function [sigfc1, sigfc2, sigma1, sigma2, arg] = fbsolv(Fcoef1, Fcoef2, ngrid)
% 
% Given the coefficients Fcoef1, Fcoef2 of the Fourier expansion of the
% protophase dynamics, computed by co_fexp2, this function computes 
% Fourier coefficients sigfc1, sigfc2 of the phase transformation. 
% Optionally it returns the transformation functions, computed on the grid
% of size ngrid.
% 
% Form of Call:
%           [sigfc1,sigfc2] =  fbsolv(Fcoef1, Fcoef2)
%           [sigfc1,sigfc2,sigma1,sigma2,arg] = fbsolv(Fcoef1,Fcoef2)
%           [sigfc1,sigfc2,sigma1,sigma2,arg] = fbsolv(Fcoef1,Fcoef2,ngrid)
%
% INPUT
%  Fcoef1:   Coefficients of Fourier expansion of the protophase dynamics 
%            of the 1st oscillator, produced by co_fexp2. 
%  Fcoef2:   Coefficients of protophase dynamics of the 2nd oscillator,  
%            produced by co_fexp2.
%  ngrid:    grid size is required only if sigma1, sigma 2 are computed
%            Default value is ngrid = 100.
%   
% OUTPUT
%  sigfc1:   Fourier coefficients of the 1st phase transformation function
%  sigfc2:   Fourier coefficients of the 2st phase transformation function
%  sigma1:   Transformation function for the 1st oscillator
%  sigma2:   Transformation function for the 2nd oscillator
%            These function can be plotted as  plot(arg, sigma2)
%  arg:      argument for plotting sigma1 / sigma2

function [phi1,phi2,omeg1,omeg2,q1,q2,Nrmq1,Nrmq2,dirin] =...
    ittransf2(theta1,theta2,or,fsamp,ngrid)

% This high-level function performs all steps of the phase transformation at once,
% using the iteration method.
% Given two protophases theta1 and theta2, the order of the Fourier expansion (or), 
% the sampling frequency of the data (fsamp),  and the grid size (ngrid), this
% function computes: 
%      the true phases phi1 and phi2, 
%      the true coupling functions q1 and q2 on a grid of size ngrid, 
%      the frequencies (constant terms of coupling functions) omeg1 and omeg2,
%      the norms of the coupling functions, norm1 and norm2, 
%      and the directionality index dirin.
% Form of call: 
%      [phi1,phi2,omeg1,omeg2,q1,q2,Nrmq1,Nrmq2,dirin] = ittransf2(theta1,theta2,or,fsamp,ngrid)
%      [phi1,phi2,omeg1,omeg2,q1,q2,Nrmq1,Nrmq2,dirin] = ittransf2(theta1,theta2,or,fsamp)
% Input:
%       theta1:     protophase of the 1st signal
%       theta2:     protopahse of the 2nd signal
%       or:         order of the Fourier expansion: or = 10 is a good first choice.
%       fsamp:      sampling frequency
%       ngrid:      size of the grid to compute q1, q2; default value is ngrid=100
% Output: 
%       phi1:       true phase of the 1st oscillator
%       phi2:       true phase of the 2nd oscillator
%       omeg1:      autonomous frequency (constant term of the coupling function) of the 1st oscillator
%       omeg2:      autonomous frequency (constant term of the coupling function) of the 2nd oscillator
%       q1:         coupling function of the 1st oscillator, computed on an a grid 
%                   Note: It does not contain the constant term, i.e. the
%                   phase dynamics is given by dphi1/dt = omeg1 + q1(phi1,phi2).
%       q2:         coupling function of the 2nd oscillator, computed on a
%                   grid, without constant term.
%       Nrmq1:      the norm of q1.
%       Nrmq2:      the norm of q2.
%       dirin:      the index of directionality of interaction between both oscillators: 
%                   dirin = 1: unidirectional coupling from 1 to 2. 
%                   dirin = -1: unidirectional coupling from 2 to 1.
%                   dirin = 0: equally strong bidirectional coupling

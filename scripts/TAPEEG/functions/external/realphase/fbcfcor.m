function[COR, Del1, Del2, Qcoef2_shift]=fbcfcor(Qcoef1, Qcoef2, ngrid) 
% 
%
% This function computes the correlation between two coupling functions
% given in terms of Fourier coefficients Qcoef1, Qcoef2. The correlation
% is defined as the maximum over all possible relative shifts of two coupling
% functions. The resolution of tested phase shifts is defined by ngrid.  
% In the computation, the coupling function of the first oscillator is taken
% as a reference, while the second one is shifted with respect to the
% first.
% 
% Form of call: 
%               COR = co_fbcfcor(Qcoef1, Qcoef2) 
%               COR = co_fbcfcor(Qcoef1, Qcoef2, ngrid)

%               [COR, Delta1, Delta2, Qcoef2_shift]=co_fbcfcor(Qcoef1, Qcoef2, ngrid) 
% Input:
%       Qcoef1, Qcoef2: The Fourier coefficients of both coupling functions
%       ngrid:          grid size, defaul is ngrid =100
% Output:
%       COR:            Maxmimal correlation of the coupling functions
%       Del1, Del2      Shifts of the own (phi2) and external (phi1) 
%                       phases which maximize the correlation between
%                       the shifted second coupling function and
%                       the first one (reference)  
%       Qcoef2_shift:   Fourier coefficients of the shifted coupling
%                       function for the second oscillator. Correlation
%                       between this function and the first one is maximal
%                       for zero shifts.

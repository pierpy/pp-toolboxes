function [Fcoef1, Fcoef2, f1, f2]=fexp2(theta1,theta2,or,safr,ngrid)

% Given two protophases, the function yields the coupling functions 
% f1(theta1,theta2) and f2(theta2,theta1) via fitting a Fourier series. 
%
% Form of call: 
%          [Fcoef1,Fcoef2,f1,f2]=fexp2(theta1,theta2,or,safr,ngrid)

%          [Fcoef1,Fcoef2]=fexp2(theta1,theta2,or,safr) 
% Input:   theta1: protophase of the 1st system,
%          theta2: protophase of the 2nd system ('external'),
%          or:     maximal order of Fourier expansion,

%          ngrid:  size of the grid for function computation, 
%                  by default ngrid =  100
% Output:  Fcoef1,Fcoef2 are Fourier coefficients of the coupling functions

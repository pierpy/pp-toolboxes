function [Fcoef,f]=fexp1(theta1,theta2,or,safr,ngrid)

% Given two protophases, the function yields the coupling 
% function f(theta1,theta2) via fitting a Fouriers series. 
%
% Form of call: 
%          [Fcoef,f]=fexp1(theta1,theta2,or,safr,ngrid)
%          [Fcoef]=fexp1(theta1,theta2,or,safr,ngrid)
%          [Fcoef]=fexp1(theta1,theta2,or,safr) 
% Input:   theta1: protophase of the 1st system,
%          theta2: protophase of the 2nd system ('external'),
%          or:     maximal order of Fourier expansion,
%          safr:   sampling frequency,
%          ngrid:  size of the grid for function computation,
%                  by default ngrid =  100
% Output:  Fcoeff are Fourier coefficients of the coupling function
%          f is the function itself, computed on a grid

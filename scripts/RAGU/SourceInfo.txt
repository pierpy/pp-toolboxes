This is the Matlab source code for the Ragu program. 

This source code is intended to
- run Ragu on different platforms,
- inspect and modify the source code to improve the program,
- compile the code and distribute compiled versions of the program for
  usage under different platforms.

The entire source is under the GNU AFFERO General Public License that comes
with the source code.

If you modify the source code please inform me (thomas.koenig@puk.unibe.ch)
so I try to include appropriate modifications in the original version of
the program.
